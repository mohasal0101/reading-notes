### -  What is a "Component" ?
<p> A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components and exporting high-level interface, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.</p>

### - What are the characteristics of a component?
> Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
>
> Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.
>
> Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
>
> Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
>
> Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
>
> Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### - What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
> Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.
>
> Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.
>
> Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.
>
> Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.
>
> Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.
>
> Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.
>
> System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.
>
> Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the
> software development and future software development.
